## QR Codes are cool!

This program outputs a QRcode as either a PNG, JPEG, or GIF.
Max image size of 1480*1480 pixels.

Optional "Bulk" mode at `bulkqr.php` if you want to generate *lots* of QR codes

Supports QRcode version 1-40.

Requires PHP4.1 and gd 1.6 or higher.

Usage:
qr.php?d=[data]&e=[(L,M,Q,H)]&s=[int]&v=[(1-40)]&t=[(J,G)]&size=[int]&download=[filename]
		 (&m=[(1-16)]&n=[(2-16)](&p=[(0-255)],&o=[data]))

 d		= data				URL encoded data.
 e		= ECC level			L or M or Q or H   (default M)
 s		= module size		(dafault PNG:4 JPEG:8)
 v		= version			1-40 or Auto select if you do not set.
 t		= image type		J: jpeg image, G: GIF image, default: PNG image
 size	= image size		Integer. Specifies the width & height of the image. Default 400. Max 1480.
 download = File name	URL encoded filename. If set, the content disposition will change to tell the browser to download the file.

Will encode a QR code containin the word "hello" with Quartile error correction, as a JPG, 500px wide & high, and prompt you to download it as a file called "test.jpg".
